# Target
This app is designed for those who feel nostalgic for the days when mini-games dominated the internet, hackers hastily built apps in Adobe Flash, and the aroma of drip coffee was the only thing keeping you awake.

But today, we have powerful computers, bean-to-cup coffee machines, and mobile pay-to-play games. In contrast to the "more is better" mindset, `hermes-crypto` offers a playful, light-hearted experience. It's a page you open, cast a quick vote, and then take 60 seconds to pause—while your code compiles or your coffee machine heats up—to reflect, meditate, and appreciate the simpler moments in life.

# Design Pillars

The design pillars behind `hermes-crypto` aims to be fun by focussing on achieving the following design cohesion:
- Redefining Kitsch
- Engaging with Camp
- Embracing RetroWave (**Most Important**)

For a deeper insight into what kitsch and camp are in culture, please refer to this published called [Redefining Kitsch and Camp in Literature and Culture](https://www.cambridgescholars.com/resources/pdfs/978-1-4438-6221-9-sample.pdf).

## Redefining Kitsch

Kitsch in the modern sense refers to art, objects, or design that are considered to be in poor taste due to excessive garishness, sentimentality, or ostentatiousness. However, its meaning and usage have evolved over time. For `hermes-crypto` we are _not_ saying that the application has to be ugly or in poor taste, but rather we are redefining kitsch with nostalgia. This means we aim to:

- Ironic appreciation: Many people now enjoy kitsch ironically, finding humor or charm in its over-the-top or tacky qualities. That is what we aim for.
- Nostalgia: Kitsch often evokes a sense of nostalgia, particularly for mid-20th century aesthetics.
- Camp aesthetic: Kitsch is closely related to camp, which celebrates exaggeration and artifice (More on this down below).
- Pop culture: Kitsch is often associated with mass-produced items that reference popular culture.
- Subversive art: Some artists deliberately use kitsch elements to challenge traditional notions of "high art." Whilst only a game, at our heart we attract rebels and we signal that by rebelling visually.
- Cultural relativity: What's considered kitsch can vary greatly between cultures and time periods. However digital kitsch is more universal as it is a collective meeting point that breaks geographical and social barriers.

## Engaging with Camp

Camp is an aesthetic style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad taste and ironic value. While closely related to kitsch, camp has some distinct characteristics:
- Deliberate exaggeration: Camp often involves intentionally over-the-top, exaggerated styles or performances.
- Irony and humor: Unlike kitsch, which might be unintentionally tacky, camp usually involves a knowing wink to the audience.
- Artificiality: Camp celebrates the unnatural, artificial, and exaggerated over the authentic.
- Theatricality: There's often a performative aspect to camp, whether in fashion, film, or other media.
- Nostalgic appeal: Like kitsch, camp often draws on past styles, particularly mid-20th century aesthetics.
- Self-aware bad taste: Camp embraces what might be considered bad taste, but does so knowingly and often with affection.

Camp can be seen as a way of viewing and interacting with kitsch - appreciating its excesses and finding joy in its apparent tackiness. While kitsch might be unintentionally over-the-top, camp often deliberately plays with these elements for artistic or humorous effect.

## Embracing Retrowave
Retrowave, or digital kitsch is directly where we fall into with our app. In the context of kitsch and camp, retrowave represents a modern, self-aware approach to nostalgia. It takes elements that might have been considered kitsch in their original context (like over-the-top '80s aesthetics) and reframes them through a lens of intentional stylization and appreciation, much like camp does. However, retrowave tends to be more earnest in its appreciation of its source material than traditional camp, occupying a unique space between sincere nostalgia and ironic reinterpretation.

Retrowave has been incorporated into `hermes-crypto` with a softer color palette to enhance accessibility and readability. When adding elements, we should avoid overusing effects, maintain a soft palette, ensure elements enhance the user experience, and continue to follow good UX standards.
