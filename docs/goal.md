# App Goal

This is the mission statement. What are the object parameters of `hermes-crypto`? What is the base problem? What marks should it meet?

## Goal Outline

In short, the goal of this app is to achieve the following:

```
- Creating a webapp where users of the app can guess if the price of BTC will go up or down.
- Keep track of users' score and display it to them.
- There is a 60-second buffer between guesses.
- Right guess? +1! Wrong guess? -1. The scoring is simple.
- You can only make one guess at a time and if you are new here, then you start off with a score of 0.
```
