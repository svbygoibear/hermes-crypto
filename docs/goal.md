# App Goal

This is the mission statement. What are the object parameters of `hermes-crypto`? What is the base problem? What marks should it meet?

## Goal Outline

In short, the goal of this app is to achieve the following:

```
- Creating a webapp where users of the app can guess if the price of BTC will go up or down.
- Keep track of users' score and display it to them.
- There is a 60-second buffer between guesses.
- Right guess? +1! Wrong guess? -1. The scoring is simple.
- You can only make one guess at a time and if you are new here, then you start off with a score of 0.
```

## Personal Goals

Ah this might be a bit of a challenge, but this is also an opportunity. Apart from achieve the minimum goal above, my personal goals and objectives include:

### Making a fun page

This app should be easy to use, look good (or at least not like we are stuck in 2002) and intuitive. Thought has been put into the user experience with every element added.

### Learning new things

The majority of my experience is with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us). Why not take this opportunity to work more with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqPI88jxIWR8kZ0xNAw04eCnmxbf9p86htDlwNYuRfe7VUQkdn2r6iRoCa1YQAvD_BwE&trk=946a9192-9b37-44c7-8b34-dbfa59d5a000&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqPI88jxIWR8kZ0xNAw04eCnmxbf9p86htDlwNYuRfe7VUQkdn2r6iRoCa1YQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!455709741510!e!!g!!aws!10817378570!108173613722&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) instead? Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) & [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)? Why not throw in some [serverless](https://www.datadoghq.com/knowledge-center/serverless-architecture/) API code in there as well? The goal here is to challenge myself while showing not only my core skills, but that I am able to learn as well. 

### Staying in a budget

The budget here refers both to time and money. The spirit is to learn new things, but it is also to:

-   Keep the budget as tight as possible. Where something can be free, let it be. The most costly thing should be paying for the domain without taking too many short-cuts.
-   Time is money and money is time. Each part of this project is on a "time" limit and where there is not time to do something 100% properly the balance is to do it _well enough_ for what this project is.

### Making something that feels "legit"

From the way the app looks & functions, to having SSL & actual deployments; the goal is that this thing should feel legit. Yes, around a weekend of work but _also_ not something just thrown-up.
